## 🔍 Overview

SSCBDTA is a deep learning model for predicting drug-target binding affinity (DTA), which integrates secondary sequences (generated via Byte Pair Encoding) and multiple attention blocks (cross-attention and criss-cross attention).

This repository provides the implementation, data, and scripts for reproducing our results as described in the paper:

## 📌 Key Features

- Utilizes **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** to generate secondary sequences for drugs and proteins.
- Incorporates **cross-attention** and **criss-cross attention** mechanisms to enhance feature fusion.
- Achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on Davis and KIBA datasets.
- Demonstrates potential in **anti-COVID drug screening** based on binding predictions with SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
